    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "As a computational and data-focused scientist, I've found Python to be a near-perfect fit for the types of problems I face, whether it's extracting meaning from large social network datasets, scraping and munging data sources from the Web, or automating day-to-day research tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it.\n",
    "For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NumPy](http://numpy.org) provides efficient storage and computation for multi-dimensional data arrays.\n",
    "- [SciPy](http://scipy.org) contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numerical integration and interpolation.\n",
    "- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "- [IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) provides an enhanced terminal and an interactive notebook environment that is useful for exploratory analysis, as well as creation of interactive, executable documents. For example, the manuscript for this report was composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "No less important are the numerous other tools and packages which accompany these: if there is a scientific or data analysis task you want to perform, chances are someone has written a package that will do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tap into the **power** of this data science ecosystem, however, first requires **familiarity with the Python language itself**.\n",
    "I often encounter students and colleagues who have (sometimes extensive) backgrounds in computing in some language – MATLAB, IDL, R, Java, C++, etc. – and are looking for a brief but comprehensive tour of the Python language that respects their level of knowledge rather than starting from ground zero.\n",
    "This report seeks to fill that niche.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, this report in no way aims to be a comprehensive introduction to programming, or a full introduction to the Python language itself; if that is what you are looking for, you might check out one of the recommended references listed in [Resources for Learning](16-Further-Resources.ipynb).\n",
    "Instead, this will provide a whirlwind tour of some of Python's essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language.\n",
    "My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the authors\n",
    "\n",
    "This material was created by Jake VanderPlas. I (Jim Bagrow) have made minor revisions, deletions and insertions only, with the goal of specializing this text to University of Vermont's Data Science Course (STAT/CS 287).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the licensing details from the original text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We appreciate, but do not require, attribution.\n",
    "An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN.\n",
    "For example: \"A Whirlwind Tour of Python by Jake VanderPlas (O’Reilly). Copyright 2016 O’Reilly Media, Inc., 978-1-491-96465-1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I would appreciate, but do not require, attribution alongside Jake VanderPlas if any derivations come from my specialization of the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Python and the suite of libraries that enable scientific computing is straightforward whether you use Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. This section will outline some of the considerations when setting up your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 2 vs Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This report uses the syntax of Python 3, which contains language enhancements that are not compatible with the *2.x* series of Python.\n",
    "Though Python 3.0 was first released in 2008, adoption has been relatively slow, particularly in the scientific and web development communities.\n",
    "This is primarily because it took some time for many of the essential packages and toolkits to be made compatible with the new language internals.\n",
    "Since early 2014, however, stable releases of the most important tools in the data science ecosystem have been fully-compatible with both Python 2 and 3, and so this course will use the newer Python 3 syntax.\n",
    "Even though that is the case, the vast majority of code snippets here will also work with little if any modification in Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there are various ways to install Python, the one I would **strongly suggest** — particularly if you wish to eventually use the data science tools mentioned above – is via the cross-platform Anaconda distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) gives you Python and the Python standard library, a command-line tool called ``conda`` which allows you to easily install many third-party packages and libraries, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed third-party packages geared toward scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, download and install the Anaconda package – make sure to choose a version with Python 3. When finished, run the `hw00.py` script to ensure all packages for the course are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If that script terminates with an error, use conda to [TOODODO]\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on ``conda``, including information about creating and using conda environments, refer to the Anaconda package documentation linked at the above page.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's start our tour of the Python language."

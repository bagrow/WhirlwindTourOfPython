# A Whirlwind Tour of Python for STAT/CS 287

*James Bagrow, August 2016*

This mini-text serves as introductory reading for my course, [*Data Science I*](http://bagrow.com/ds1/), held at the
University of Vermont. It has been very lightly adapted and specialized from the original
[*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.csp) by Jake VanderPlas, and he deserves the overwhelming majority of credit for this work.



*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
components of the Python language for researchers and developers who are
already familiar with programming in another language.

The material is particularly aimed at those who wish to use Python for data 
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to Jake VanderPlas' upcoming book,
[*The Python Data Science Handbook*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) 
(also [on github](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)).

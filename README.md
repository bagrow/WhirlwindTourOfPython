# A Whirlwind Tour of Python for STAT/CS 287

*James Bagrow, August 2019*

This mini-text serves as introductory reading for my course, [Data Science I](http://bagrow.com/ds1), held at the
University of Vermont. It has been lightly adapted and specialized from the original
"A Whirlwind Tour of Python"
by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/), and he deserves most of the credit for this work.



*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
components of the [Python language](https://www.python.org) for researchers and developers who are
already familiar with programming in another language.

The material is particularly aimed at those who wish to use Python for data 
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to Jake VanderPlas' book, The Python Data Science Handbook.
